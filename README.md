# intrusion_detection

NOTE: To run this program you need a mysql database setup and emai account that both have the same email.

The main app is a python script running a Flask server that runs with the following command while in the main directory:

python3 main_app.py [-host ip address] [-port port number] 

The host is localhost and port is 5000 by default. Given these are the parameters used, then open a web browser and type the following into the address bar:

localhost:5000

You should then see the main page (log in page) display in the browser and the terminal should display output indicating the Flask server is running.
